Automatic Zoom
Technical Specification: AI Module for 
Automating Public Space Usage 
Requests (ZUVP) 
1. Overview & Project Objective 
The goal is to develop a Flask application to fully automate the processing of applications for 
"Special Use of Public Space" (e.g., placing containers, excavation work). The system must 
handle unstructured inputs, extract key data using AI, automatically generate official 
documents (Consent/Permit), and prepare the necessary payment instructions. 
2. Process Architecture (Pipeline) 
The application processing is divided into four main stages, forming the automated workflow. 
1.  Ingestion: Receiving input data (local folder, file uploads). 
2.  Extraction & Analysis (AI Core): Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and entity 
extraction using an LLM. 
3.  Generation: Creating official PDF documents based on templates. 
4.  Action: Draft creation and preparation for distribution. 
3. Detailed Functional Requirements 
A. Ingestion Module 
Requirement  Description 
Supported Formats  PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX, TXT. 
Input Sources  1. Local folder: Monitoring Zadosti/ folder 
for new files. 2. REST API Endpoint: For 
direct file uploads. 
Key Requirement (OCR)  The system must effectively handle 
handwritten forms (scanned 
images/photos). 
B. Extraction & Analysis (AI Core) 
This phase is the core AI engine that transforms unstructured input data into structured 
output. 
●  Entity Extraction: Applicant name, Company ID, Contact details, Purpose of use, 
Specific Location (address/plot number), Duration (Start-End date) 
C. Document Engine (sample form is here) 
1. Permit/Consent Generation 
The system populates predefined templates (DOCX/HTML) with the data extracted in the AI 
phase: 
●  Populating Applicant Details. 
●  Inserting the Duration and Purpose of use. 
●  Appending standard legal conditions/boilerplate text. 
2. Fee Calculation 
The calculation of the total fee is governed by the following logic: 
 
 
$$\text{Fee} = \text{Area}_{\text{sqm}} \times \text{Duration}_{\text{days}} \times 
\text{Rate}_{\text{per sqm/day}}$$ 
 
●  Rate: Must be configurable (e.g., 10 CZK/m²/day). 
3. Payment Instructions 
●  Generation of a Variable Symbol (VS) linked to the $request\_id$. 
●  Formatting bank account details, amount, and VS into a structured format. 
D. Output & Notification 
●  Draft Mode (Recommended): The AI system does not send emails directly to the 
public. Instead, it creates an internal "Draft" entry (or sends an email to the clerk) 
containing all generated files. The clerk reviews the draft and confirms the sending by 
clicking "Approve/Send". 
●  Email Content Construction: 
○  Body: "Please find the Consent attached..." + "Payment Instructions: Account X, VS Y, 
Amount Z". 
○  Attachments: Generated Consent (PDF) + Payment Info (PDF).

 5. Evaluation Criteria 
-  Simplicity (lines of code — the fewer, the better) 
-  Maintainability (basic principles, folder organization, naming conventions, clean 
functions, DRY) 
-  Performance and observability (a robust yet simple logging system) 
-  Big bonus: known system metrics, failure modes, pitfalls, and limitations, possible 
improvements, parallelization
